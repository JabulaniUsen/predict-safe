# PWA Setup Guide

This application is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on mobile devices and desktops.

## Features

- **Offline Support**: Service worker caches resources for offline access
- **Install Prompt**: Modal that slides in from the bottom prompting users to install the app
- **App-like Experience**: Standalone display mode when installed
- **Mobile Optimized**: Works seamlessly on iOS and Android devices

## Installation

The PWA is automatically configured. When users visit the site on a mobile device:

1. **Android/Chrome**: A modal will appear from the bottom prompting installation
2. **iOS/Safari**: Instructions are shown on how to add to home screen via the share menu

## Files Structure

- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest configuration
- `public/icons/` - App icons in various sizes (72x72 to 512x512)
- `components/pwa/install-prompt.tsx` - Install prompt modal component
- `components/pwa/pwa-head.tsx` - Client component for PWA meta tags
- `public/sw.js` - Service worker (auto-generated by next-pwa)
- `public/workbox-*.js` - Workbox files for service worker (auto-generated)

## Generating Icons

To regenerate PWA icons from the logo:

```bash
npm run generate-icons
```

This will create all required icon sizes in `public/icons/` from `public/logo.png`.

## Configuration

PWA is configured in `next.config.ts` using `next-pwa`:

- Service worker is disabled in development mode
- Service worker is enabled in production builds
- Icons and manifest are automatically included

## Testing

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start the production server: `npm start`
3. Open in a mobile browser or Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
4. The install prompt should appear after a few seconds

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Android & Desktop)
- ✅ Safari (iOS)
- ✅ Firefox (Android)
- ⚠️ Safari (Desktop) - Limited PWA support

## Notes

- The install prompt modal respects user preferences and won't show if:
  - User has dismissed it (stored in localStorage)
  - User dismissed it less than 7 days ago
  - App is already installed
  - User is on desktop (unless they trigger the install prompt)
